<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently (2024) a second year undergraduate at KIIT University located in India. I am learning to code so that I can create impressive and astounding projects while also being able to land a high paying job in accordance to the quality of my projects.
  <br>
  <br>I would also be learning Data Structures and Algorithms as that is quite important, I have heard, in product-based companies like MAANG.
  <br>
  <br>Well, I gotta do what I gotta do. Succeed in life, get married and live a happy fulfilling life. After all, the ones who say money doesn't guarantee happiness are the ones who have never had any riches to begin with.
